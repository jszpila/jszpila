- 👋 Hi, I’m @jszpila. I've been doing JavaScript since it was a thing.
- 👀 I’m interested in progressive web apps and the novel application of JavaScript to unusual problems
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Redux-Saga, React Native, and the Polish language
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on things that are fun and weird
- 📫 Reach me at: jan [at] szpi.la
